        "en_excerpt": "The intensification of geopolitical tensions is compelling multinational corporations to reassess their global strategies, moving beyond traditional market analysis to incorporate political risk assessments. Companies are increasingly decoupling supply chains from geopolitical hotspots, diversifying manufacturing bases, and localizing operations in stable regions. This strategic pivot reflects a recognition that commercial success now depends as much on navigating political landscapes as on competitive advantages. Consequently, investment decisions are being recalibrated to prioritize resilience over short-term profitability, fundamentally altering how businesses operate internationally.",
        "cn_translation": "地缘政治紧张局势的加剧正迫使跨国公司重新评估其全球战略，超越传统的市场分析，纳入政治风险评估。企业正日益将供应链与地缘政治热点地区脱钩，多元化制造基地，并在稳定地区本地化运营。这一战略转变反映出一种认识：商业成功现在既取决于竞争优势，也取决于驾驭政治格局。因此，投资决策正在重新调整，优先考虑韧性而非短期盈利能力，从根本上改变了企业在国际上的运营方式。",

Many companies have set ambitious targets for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration, yet implementation gaps persist due to varying regulatory frameworks, resource constraints, and competing business priorities. The financial sector shows promising leadership through green bonds and nature-positive investments, but heavy industries lag behind, struggling to balance environmental stewardship with operational demands. This disparity highlights the need for standardized metrics and collaborative frameworks to accelerate meaningful action.",
