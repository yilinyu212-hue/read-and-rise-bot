        "title": "Atomic Habits",

        "takeaways": [
            "Habits are formed through a four-step loop: cue, craving, response, reward",
            "Focus on systems rather than goals to achieve lasting change",
            "Make good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying while making bad habits invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying"

        ],
        "coach_tips": "As CEO, consciously engage System 2 for strategic decisions by creating decision-making protocols that counteract biases.

        ],
        "coach_tips": "As CEO, map your current strategic landscape using the Strategy Canvas tool. Identify non-customers and their pain points. Challenge industry assumptions by asking what factors you can eliminate or reduce below industry standards while raising or creating new value. Test your blue ocean ideas with rapid, low-cost market experiments before full commitment."
